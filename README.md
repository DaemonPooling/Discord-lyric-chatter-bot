## 🌈 What's Inside?
- **LyricChatter.py:** This is where the fun things begin! This script serve as the bot's script, so it can sing a lyrics with you, or by itself! 

## 🚀 How to Use?
**Before using this, make sure you have your bot and token prepared**

1. **LyricChatter.py**: Invoke the `LyricChatter.py` first.
2. **Command**: To run it, simply run `>sing [ARTIST:str] [MUSIC_NAME:str] [DELAY:int] [SING_TOGETHER: 1 | 0]`
For instance, let's say you want to sing `Marshmello - Ritual` with the bot, where each lyric delay are 50, you can run:
`>sing Marshmello ritual 50`
Or, you want the bot sing by itself, simply run:
`>sing Marshmello ritual 50 0`
3. **Continuing the Lyrics**: Actually, you don't to be specific with the lyric. If the lyric is "I'm withou' you", you can say "Im without you", and it is still acceptable.
4. **Stopping the Lyrics**: Just run, `>stop`.. Simple :D!
